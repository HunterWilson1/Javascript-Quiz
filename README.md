# Javascript-Quiz

Description: 
I created a javascript quiz using html, css, and javascript using DOM elements. the html and css were pretty simple. I created a const for the questions, choices, and the answer choice. Then I created a bunch of other variables that are used throught the script. I made a function to hide the different screens. there is a start quiz function that calls the showQuestion function, set the timer to 60 and starts at the first question. There is also a function that counts down the time. The showQuestion function shows the question and the choices onto the screen. The check answer function declares if the answer is correct or incorrect then subtracts time then moves onto next question. There is an end quiz function that just ends quiz. The leaderboard function sorts the scores saved to the local storage and then makes it into a list. There is a save score function that just saves the score and initial to the local storage and just a simple back and clear storage button.
